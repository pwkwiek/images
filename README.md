## üì∏ Image Processing Workshop Materials
*Beauty and the Bits: A Segmentation Saga*
##
This repository contains resources for a workshop on foundational image processing techniques. The materials cover both theoretical concepts and practical applications in image analysis.

### üóÇ Topics Covered:

* **What is an Image?**
  Understanding the nature and structure of digital images.

* **Mathematical Representation**
  Fundamentals of image representation using matrices and pixel values.

* **Color Space Models**
  Exploration of RGB, HSV, and other color spaces for image analysis.

* **Image Representation**
  Formats, encoding, and pixel data organization.

* **Image Segmentation**

  * Types of segmentation
  * Common techniques (thresholding, clustering, edge detection, etc.)
  * Applications in real-world scenarios

* **Image Augmentation**

  * Techniques (rotation, flipping, noise injection, etc.)
  * Tools (OpenCV, TensorFlow, Albumentations, etc.)

### üìÅ Files Included:

* Jupyter Notebook with explanations and code
* Sample image file
* Image data stored as text
